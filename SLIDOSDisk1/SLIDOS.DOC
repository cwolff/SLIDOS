                         Wordvision Boot System Overview


   Purpose of this system is to permit the user to create a WORKING copy of

Wordvision immediately by inserting their Wordvision MASTER disk.



   The materials required are 1) Wordvision MASTER disk  2) IBM PC DOS disk

3) WORKING disk (may be bland or contain files).



   The Wordvision MASTER disk can only be duplicated by a diskcopy. It is

strongly suggested that the user makes a backup copy of their Wordvision

MASTER disk and that both are stored away for safe keeping.


   The Wordvision Boot System consist of three seperate programs. WVBOOT.EXE

occupies track 0 side 0 sector 1 of the Wordvison MASTER disk. It's task

involves verify correct disk operation as well as verifing that this disk is

indeed a Wordvision MASTER disk. WVDOS.COM ccupies 6 sectors ( track 0 side 0

sector 8 to track 1 side 0 sector 5 ). It's task involves prompt user for a

IBM PC DOS disk as well as the Wordvision MASTER disk on a single drive 

system. All disk prompted for are verifyed before the Boot System is allowed

to continue. The computer's current configuration is determined as to the

type of display as well as the number of drives ( 1 drive or 2 drives ).

IBM PC DOS is loaded into the computer and COMMAND.COM is then made a visible

file before control is transfered to IBM PC DOS. DOS then executes and then

looks for COMMAND.COM which is then loaded by IBM PC DOS. ( WVDOS.COM makes

allowance for single or double sided disk for the placement of IBMBIO.COM and

IBMDOS.COM vary in each case ). The third a final program of the Wordvision

Boot System is COMMAND.COM. It's task is to generate a Wordvision WORKING

copy for the user. As WVDOS.COM does it prompts for the appropriate disk 

and then verifies it insertion in the correct drive. Formatting is done on a

blank disk or when the user gives permission to erase the files on the

WORKING disk. COMMAND.COM will format the WORKING disk as a single sided

or double sided disk depending upon the ability of the drive. The boot track

for the WORKING disk is adjusted accordingly. If the WORKING diskette is not

formated it is checked to determine it's suutablity as a WORKING disk. Three

conditions not being meet can cause the disk's rejection. 1) not enough space

in bytes to hold the system. 2) not enough space in the directory. 3) no 

IBM PC DOS system on the disk. The user is inform if any of the condition

are present on the WORKING disk. The user is then asked to try another disk.

Finally the actual transfer of the Wordvision MASTER files takes place. Once

this has taken place the user is prompted to insert their working disk in

drive A: and upon verification the system reboots. The WORIKING disk 

through an autoexec.bat file loads and executes Wordvision writting tool.




   Current limitations. The Wordvision Boot System will currently work for

IBM PC DOS 1.0 and 1.1. Although it has been desinged to easily be modified

to become the boot track for other Vision products, it is unable to run under

IBM PC DOS 2.0. There are major differences as to the directory, file 

allocation table and the location of IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM. In order to

judge the current systems usefulness on IBM PC DOS 2.0 operating systems

further study needs to be done.
